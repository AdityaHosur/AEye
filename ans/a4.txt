The idea of wave-particle duality is that electrons and light can be both a wave and a particle depending on how you look at them. This concept is a core part of quantum physics. An experiment that showed the wave nature was the Double-Slit experiment, where electrons passing through two tiny slits created an interference pattern, just like water waves do. This clearly proved that matter has wave properties.
