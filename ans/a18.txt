Wave-particle duality is the concept that all matter and energy exhibit properties of both waves and particles. For instance, light sometimes acts as a photon (a particle) and sometimes acts like an electromagnetic wave. This dual nature is fundamental to quantum mechanics and is usually only noticeable at the subatomic level. A famous proof is the Photoelectric Effect, where light acts strictly as discrete particles (photons) ejecting electrons, proving its particle nature. This confirmed that neither the wave nor the particle model alone is complete.
