Wave-particle duality is the concept that all matter and energy exhibit properties of both waves and particles. For instance, light sometimes acts as a photon (a particle) and sometimes acts like an electromagnetic wave. This dual nature is fundamental to quantum mechanics and is usually only noticeable at the subatomic level.
