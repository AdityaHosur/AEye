Social platforms increasingly sit alongside textbooks, influencing how students discover, share, and remember material. With a deliberate approach, they enable peer explanations, quick feedback loops, and microlearning that slots into small breaks. Hashtags and curated lists can surface quality resources faster than a generic web search. But feeds are designed to capture attention, not deepen comprehension; endless scrolling fragments focus and favors superficial processing over deep work. Interruptions from notifications chop study sessions into short segments, weakening working memory and links between concepts. Algorithmic recommendations produce echo chambers that magnify popular, incomplete viewpoints while muting dissent.

Skilled learners set boundaries: mute nonessential alerts, batch replies, and migrate notes into systems that support spaced repetition and active recall. Short posts become outlines, examples, and practice questions. Group chats are most useful when they track assumptions, sources, and decisions rather than hot takes. Visual summaries should be paired with self-testing, not passive viewing. Ethics matter: cite original creators, avoid resharing misinformation, and guard privacy in shared images. Used wisely, social media can amplify learning while demanding discipline to handle its distractions.
