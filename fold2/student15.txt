Clean electricity from the sun is increasingly affordable, yet deploying it widely demands careful engineering and thoughtful policy. Photovoltaic modules are more efficient than a decade ago, while manufacturing costs have fallen, making both rooftops and utility-scale fields competitive. Sunlight is abundant but variable; clouds, seasons, and night create intermittency that must be balanced with storage, flexible demand, and strong grid ties. Batteries and thermal storage can smooth output, though they add cost and require planning for materials supply. Inverters regulate voltage, frequency, and reactive power, and smarter grids manage bidirectional flows safely. Choosing sites matters: rooftops, parking canopies, and brownfields limit habitat impacts relative to greenfield development. End-of-life programs and recycling reduce future waste.

Policy tools—net metering, feed-in tariffs, and credits—can speed adoption, but should adapt as penetration grows to maintain reliability and fairness. Community solar improves access for renters and households with shaded roofs. When paired with electrified heating, vehicles, and efficient appliances, solar contributes to deep decarbonization across sectors. With solid planning, it can deliver resilient, affordable power while cutting pollution and creating local jobs.
