Photovoltaic modules have improved in efficiency while manufacturing prices have fallen, making rooftop and utility projects competitive in many regions. Integrating solar requires inverters that regulate voltage, frequency, and reactive power, and modern grids need smart controls to handle bidirectional flows. Land use and siting matter: rooftops, parking canopies, and brownfields reduce habitat impact relative to greenfield installations.

Sunlight is abundant yet variable; clouds, seasons, and the night introduce intermittency that must be balanced by storage, flexible demand, and grid interconnections. Batteries and thermal storage can smooth output, although they add cost and require materials planning. Recycling and end-of-life programs ensure modules and components do not become future waste streams.

Policy tools—net metering, feed-in tariffs, and tax credits—accelerate adoption, but should adapt as penetration rises to maintain fairness and reliability. Community solar expands access for renters and households with shaded roofs. With robust planning and good siting, solar can deliver resilient, affordable power while cutting pollution and supporting local jobs.
