Light can be a particle and a wave at the same time. The particles of light are called photons. This is known as the dual nature of light, which is part of quantum theory. The Double-Slit experiment shows the wave nature because it creates a pattern of light and dark fringes. We can't see this dual nature for big things like baseballs.
