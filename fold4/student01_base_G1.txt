Authentication verifies an entity’s identity, while authorization decides what that verified entity is permitted to do. In practice, authentication establishes confidence that a claimant controls a credential, such as a password, cryptographic key, or biometric template. Strong schemes resist guessing, replay, and phishing by combining multiple factors, protecting secrets at rest, and binding attempts to contexts like devices and locations. Protocols such as TLS and OIDC help prove possession of a key and convey identity assertions to applications without exposing raw credentials. Correctness depends on entropy, rate limiting, secure storage, and user education.

Authorization evaluates requests against policy. Once a principal is authenticated, the system determines whether the action is allowed in the current context, considering roles, attributes, and resource ownership. Role-based access control assigns permissions via job functions; attribute-based control evaluates environment and user properties; rule systems can express exceptions and time windows. Least privilege reduces blast radius by limiting rights to what is strictly necessary, while segregation of duties prevents conflicts of interest. Auditing and revocation ensure policies evolve with organizational change and incidents. Together, authentication and authorization provide complementary assurances: first, that you know who is requesting, and second, that the request aligns with explicit, reviewable permissions.
