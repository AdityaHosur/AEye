Authentication verifies identity via control of a credential, and defenses such as multi-factor checks, secure storage, and contextual validation resist common attacks. Protocols like mutual TLS, SAML, and OpenID Connect convey identity assertions to relying parties without exposing secrets.

Authorization evaluates requests against roles, attributes, and ownership, enforcing least privilege and separation of duties. Fine-grained scopes and time limits tighten control over sensitive operations, while step-up authentication addresses elevated risk. Auditing and revocation keep access aligned with change. Together, the two functions establish who is acting and ensure their actions conform to explicit policy.
