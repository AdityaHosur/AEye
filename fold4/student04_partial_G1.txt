Authentication verifies identity by establishing that a claimant controls a valid credential, typically a password, cryptographic key, or biometric pattern. Robust implementations resist guessing and replay by requiring multiple factors, protecting secrets at rest, and tying attempts to devices and locations through context. Protocols such as TLS and OpenID Connect allow proof of key possession and transport identity assertions without exposing raw secrets.

In applied systems, authorization governs actions based on policy evaluated against roles, attributes, and resource ownership. Least privilege narrows permissions to essentials, and separation of duties prevents conflicts of interest in sensitive workflows. Modern deployments introduce session lifetimes, step-up checks for risky operations, and fine-grained scopes for APIs. Auditing and rapid revocation integrate with incident response and compliance. These practices ensure that identity assurance precedes access decisions and that each approved action matches intentional, reviewable permissions.
