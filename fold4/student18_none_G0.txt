Identity assurance and permission control address different questions and must be designed to complement one another without conflation. Authentication confirms who is acting through proofs of possession, knowledge, or inherence, while authorization constrains what is permitted using policy that references roles, attributes, and environment. Least privilege and separation of duties limit exposure and conflict, and revocation adapts entitlements to change.

Modern systems use standards to avoid handling raw secrets and to maintain portability. WebAuthn and OIDC convey proofs and identity assertions, while policy decision points evaluate requests using ABAC or RBAC. Step-up checks and time-bound scopes address elevated risk and long-lived access. Continuous auditing connects actions to principals and supports accountability. With clear separation, systems answer both questions reliably: who is acting and whether the requested action is allowed.
