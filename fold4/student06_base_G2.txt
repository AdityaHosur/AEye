Authentication establishes identity assurance, while authorization governs permitted actions under policy. In authentication, a claimant demonstrates control of a secret or token, such as a password, possession of a private key, or a biometric feature matched against an enrolled template. Defense in depth uses multiple factors, resistant storage, and contextual checks to counter guessing, replay, and credential theft. Protocols including mutual TLS, SAML, and OIDC allow secure assertion of identity to relying applications without disclosing sensitive material.

Authorization evaluates requests in context. Policies reference roles, attributes, and ownership to determine whether an operation is allowed. Role-based access control aligns permissions with job functions; attribute-based approaches consider user properties, resource sensitivity, and environmental conditions; policy engines capture exceptions and temporal limits. Least privilege and separation of duties reduce systemic risk by minimizing granted rights and preventing conflicts. Auditing, delegation, and revocation keep access current and accountable. The synergy ensures systems first confirm who is acting, then strictly constrain what they may do.
