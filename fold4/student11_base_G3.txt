Authentication demonstrates identity through possession or knowledge of a credential, while authorization constrains actions under formal policy. Passwords, cryptographic keys, and biometrics serve as evidence in authentication; layered defenses such as multi-factor checks, resistant storage, and contextual validation counter guessing and replay. Standards like WebAuthn, OAuth2/OIDC, and TLS carry proofs of possession and identity assertions to applications with minimal exposure of secrets.

Authorization determines whether a verified principal may perform an operation given current conditions. Role-based models align permissions with job duties; attribute-based systems consider user traits, resource sensitivity, and environment; policy languages express exceptions and temporal windows. Least privilege and separation of duties reduce risk by minimizing entitlements and preventing conflicts. Continuous auditing, just-in-time elevation, and revocation maintain accountability. Coordinated design ensures systems first know who is acting and then allow only actions that match explicit, reviewable permissions.
