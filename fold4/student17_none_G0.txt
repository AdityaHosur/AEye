In security architecture, authentication establishes identity and authorization governs which actions are allowed for that identity. Treating them as separate capabilities clarifies guarantees and simplifies design. Authentication relies on possession, knowledge, or inherence factors and should use multiple checks, protect secrets in storage, and bind attempts to context. Authorization evaluates requests against policies that reference roles, attributes, and resource ownership, applying least privilege and separation of duties.

When systems scale, standards help: WebAuthn and OIDC carry proofs and assertions, and policy engines apply ABAC or RBAC at runtime. Sensitive operations benefit from step-up authentication and time-bound entitlements. Auditing provides accountability and feeds change management and incident response. Maintaining independence between identity assurance and permission grants reduces risk and makes behavior more predictable.
