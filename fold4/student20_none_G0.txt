Security systems address two distinct questions: who is acting and what are they allowed to do. Authentication answers the first by proving control of a credential through possession, knowledge, or inherence. Authorization answers the second by applying policy based on roles, attributes, and environment to constrain actions. Least privilege and separation of duties narrow entitlements, and revocation adjusts access as conditions evolve.

Standards and architecture choices matter. WebAuthn and OIDC transmit proofs and identity assertions to applications, while policy decision points evaluate RBAC or ABAC rules. Step-up authentication and time-bound scopes manage elevated risk. Auditing ties actions to principals for accountability. By designing authentication and authorization as cooperating but independent capabilities, systems deliver reliable guarantees with lower exposure.
