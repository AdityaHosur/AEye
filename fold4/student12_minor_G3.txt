Authentication provides identity assurance, and authorization constrains actions under policy. Evidence includes passwords, keys, or biometrics, with defenses such as multi-factor checks, hardened storage, and contextual validation countering attacks. WebAuthn, OAuth2/OIDC, and TLS carry proofs of possession and identity assertions to relying applications.

Authorization evaluates whether a principal may perform an operation, using roles, attributes, and environment as inputs. RBAC ties permissions to duties; ABAC weighs user properties and resource sensitivity; policy languages encode exceptions and time bounds. Least privilege, separation of duties, and auditing limit exposure and maintain accountability. Together, these components establish identity and enforce permissible actions.
