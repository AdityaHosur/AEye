Authentication provides identity assurance by proving control of a credential, and authorization applies policy to constrain actions. Claimants demonstrate possession of passwords, keys, or biometrics, while layered defenses—multi-factor checks, secure storage, and contextual validation—counter guessing, replay, and phishing. Protocols such as mutual TLS, SAML, and OIDC carry identity assertions to relying systems without revealing raw secrets.

Authorization evaluates whether a principal may perform an operation under the current conditions. Roles, attributes, and ownership feed into RBAC, ABAC, and rule engines that express exceptions and temporal constraints. Least privilege narrows entitlements; separation of duties limits conflict risk; auditing and revocation keep permissions aligned with organizational reality. In combination, authentication establishes who is acting, and authorization ensures their actions match explicit, reviewable policy.
