Authentication focuses on proving identity, while authorization determines permissible actions after identity is established. In authentication, a claimant demonstrates control of a credential, such as a password, cryptographic key, or biometric pattern. Resilience to guessing, replay, and phishing is achieved through multi-factor checks, secret protection, and contextual binding to devices or locations. Protocols including TLS and OIDC convey proof of key possession and identity assertions without revealing underlying secrets. Effective designs depend on entropy, attempt throttling, secure storage, and user awareness.

Authorization decides whether an authenticated principal may perform an operation, guided by roles, attributes, and ownership. RBAC ties permissions to job duties; ABAC evaluates user properties and environment; policy engines express exceptions and temporal constraints. Least privilege and separation of duties limit exposure and prevent conflicts. Auditing, monitoring, and revocation align permissions with organizational realities over time. Taken together, the two functions ensure systems know who is requesting and that requests conform to explicit, reviewable policy.
