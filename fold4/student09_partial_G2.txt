Authentication creates confidence in identity by demonstrating control of a credential, often a password, private key, or biometric sample. Multi-factor checks, secret protection, and contextual validation counter guessing and replay. Protocols including mutual TLS, SAML, and OIDC transmit identity assertions securely to applications.

Authorization then applies policy to decide whether a verified principal may perform an operation, considering roles, attributes, and ownership. Least privilege limits entitlements, separation of duties reduces conflicts, and time-bound scopes constrain sensitive actions. Systems introduce step-up checks when risk rises and audit trails for accountability. These arrangements ensure identity is established before access decisions and that permissions reflect explicit, reviewable intent.
