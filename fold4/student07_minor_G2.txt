Authentication creates confidence in identity, and authorization constrains actions according to policy. A claimant proves control of a credential—password, cryptographic key, or biometric—while defenses such as multi-factor checks, hardened storage, and contextual validation resist guessing, replay, and theft. Standards like mutual TLS, SAML, and OpenID Connect securely convey identity assertions to applications without disclosing secrets.

Authorization decides whether a verified principal may proceed, using roles, attributes, and ownership as inputs. RBAC aligns permissions with job duties; ABAC considers user traits, resource sensitivity, and environment; policy systems encode exceptions and time-based limits. Least privilege and separation of duties minimize exposure and prevent conflicts. Auditing and revocation maintain accountability and adapt to change. Together, these practices first establish who is acting and then enforce what is permissible.
