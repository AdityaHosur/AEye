Authentication proves identity, and authorization limits actions using policy. Mixing the two obscures guarantees and often leads to brittle systems. Authentication should use multiple factors, protect secrets at rest, and validate context; authorization should apply least privilege, separation of duties, and explicit scopes tied to roles and attributes. Revocation and auditing keep entitlements aligned with change.

Standards reduce risk and improve interoperability. WebAuthn and OIDC carry proofs and identity assertions without exposing raw credentials, and policy engines express RBAC or ABAC rules with exceptions and temporal limits. Sensitive operations can require step-up checks, while session lifetimes minimize exposure. Clear separation between identity assurance and access control yields predictable behavior at scale.
