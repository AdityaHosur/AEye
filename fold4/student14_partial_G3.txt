Authentication demonstrates identity by proving control of credentials such as passwords, keys, or biometrics. Multi-factor checks, resistant storage, and contextual validation counter guessing and replay, while standards like WebAuthn and OAuth2/OIDC transport identity assertions securely.

Authorization decides whether an authenticated principal may proceed, referencing roles, attributes, and environment. Least privilege narrows entitlements, separation of duties reduces conflicts, and just-in-time elevation limits exposure. Systems use step-up authentication for sensitive actions and time-bound scopes for APIs. Auditing and revocation keep permissions aligned with organizational change. This coordination ensures identity assurance precedes access decisions and that approved actions reflect explicit, reviewable policy.
