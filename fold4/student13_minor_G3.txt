Authentication assures identity via control of credentials, while authorization applies policy to constrain actions. Passwords, keys, and biometrics provide evidence; layered defenses—multi-factor checks, secure storage, contextual validation—counter guessing and replay. WebAuthn, OAuth2/OIDC, and TLS convey proofs and assertions without exposing secrets.

Authorization relies on roles, attributes, and environment. RBAC maps permissions to duties; ABAC considers user and resource properties; policy languages express exceptions and schedules. Least privilege limits entitlements; separation of duties prevents conflicts; auditing and revocation maintain oversight. Coordinated authentication and authorization first identify who acts and then ensure actions match explicit, reviewable permissions.
