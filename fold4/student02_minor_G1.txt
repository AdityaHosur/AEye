Authentication confirms identity and authorization governs allowed actions. Authentication establishes confidence that a claimant controls a credential, such as a password, private key, or biometric sample. Robust designs resist guessing, replay, and phishing through multi-factor checks, protected storage, and binding attempts to devices or locations. Standards like TLS and OpenID Connect prove possession of keys and transport identity assertions to applications without exposing secrets. Sound practice relies on sufficient entropy, throttling of attempts, secure handling, and informed users.

Authorization evaluates whether a verified principal may perform a requested operation in a specific context, using roles, attributes, and resource ownership. Role-based control maps permissions to job functions; attribute-based approaches consider user and environment properties; rule engines capture exceptions and schedules. Least privilege limits rights to essentials, and separation of duties reduces conflict risks. Audit trails and timely revocation adapt policy to change and incident response. In combination, these mechanisms first establish who is acting and then ensure that their actions match explicit, reviewable permissions.
