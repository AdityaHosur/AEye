Authentication and authorization are distinct functions that must be coordinated but are implemented independently. Authentication verifies identity by proving control of a credential, while authorization applies policy to decide which operations are permitted under current conditions. Systems that blend these concerns confuse trust in identity with entitlement to act, leading to oversharing and fragile designs.

Practical architectures separate identity providers from policy decision points. Identity providers issue assertions after verifying credentials via passwords, keys, or biometrics, and protect secrets with multi-factor checks and contextual validation. Policy decision points evaluate requests using roles, attributes, and environmental data, enforcing least privilege, separation of duties, and time-bound scopes. Auditing and revocation connect outcomes to accountability and incident response. This division of responsibilities ensures clear guarantees: confidence in who is acting and disciplined control over what they may do.
