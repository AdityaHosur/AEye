Authentication is the process of verifying identity by proving control of a credential, such as a password, private key, or biometric template. Strong designs combine multiple factors, store secrets securely, and bind attempts to context to resist guessing, replay, and phishing. Standards like TLS and OIDC convey proof of possession and transport identity assertions without exposing underlying secrets.

Authorization, in turn, evaluates whether a verified principal may perform a specific operation, referencing roles, attributes, and ownership. Least privilege, separation of duties, and explicit scopes limit exposure and clarify intent. Systems often require step-up authentication for sensitive actions and enforce session lifetimes to reduce risk. Continuous auditing and timely revocation align policies with change. Together, these functions ensure the system first knows who is acting and then verifies that their requested actions accord with defined, reviewable permissions.
