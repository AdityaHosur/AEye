Computers operate as synchronous state machines guided by a clock and by rules encoded in logic and microcode. The stored-program concept places instructions with data in memory so the processor can fetch, interpret fields, and drive execution units to update state. Multicore and multithreaded designs provide concurrency, and the memory model defines allowed re-orderings among threads. Locks, atomics, and barriers coordinate shared access, and coherence protocols propagate writes so replicas agree. I/O controllers use interrupts and DMA to exchange data without monopolizing the CPU.

Software imposes structure: an operating system schedules tasks, enforces isolation via virtual memory and privilege levels, and offers file and network abstractions. Virtualization layers rely on hardware support to isolate entire operating systems through nested page tables and IOMMUs. Compilers, linkers, and loaders translate programs and arrange them in address spaces. The result is a machine that realizes algorithms as predictable state changes under policies that balance fairness, efficiency, and security.
