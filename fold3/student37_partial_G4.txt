Sensors and storage supply encoded symbols that are placed into memory, and the CPU advances an instruction stream by fetching bytes, decoding opcodes, and dispatching work to arithmetic and vector units. Caches exploit locality to reduce average access times, while pipelining and speculation keep execution resources occupied.

Around this core, the operating system schedules tasks, enforces isolation using virtual memory, and exposes device drivers. File systems journal updates and recover after faults, and networking stacks segment data into packets and reassemble streams securely. Timers and interrupts bind software to real time, allowing responsive behavior. Together these layers regulate a pipeline from inputs to outputs so that computation remains correct and efficient.
