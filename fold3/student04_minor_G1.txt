The computer can be viewed as a stack of abstractions that converts user goals into electrical operations. At the foundation, transistors behave as tiny switches, combining into logic gates for arithmetic and control. Those gates form a datapath synchronized by a clock, allowing the CPU to fetch instructions, decode meaning, execute, and write results. The memory system manages speed and volume: registers enable single-cycle access; caches keep frequent data nearby using locality; main memory stores active programs; persistent storage retains data without power. Buses and interconnects move information through standardized signaling.

Hardware is orchestrated by software layers. The operating system handles process scheduling, memory management, and device drivers so applications focus on logic rather than signals. Compilers and assemblers translate high-level code into machine instructions, while runtimes add services such as dynamic linking and garbage collection. Inputs transform touch and motion into digital data; outputs encode pixels, sound, or network packets. Networking extends the machine via protocol stacks that define addressing, reliability, and security. Ultimately, the computer works by chaining simple, deterministic operations into long sequences that realize complex tasks with consistent precision.
