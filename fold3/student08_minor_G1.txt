A computer is best understood as a stack of layers that convert user intent into disciplined electrical activity. At the foundation, transistors serve as microscopic switches that form logic gates, enabling arithmetic and control. Those gates combine into a datapath synchronized by a clock, allowing the CPU to fetch instructions, decode their purpose, execute steps, and commit results. The memory hierarchy balances speed and capacity: registers offer single-cycle access near the processor; caches leverage locality to keep hot data close; main memory stores active code and data; and persistent storage preserves information when power is removed. Standardized buses and interconnects coordinate movement of bits among components.

Software orchestrates hardware through abstraction layers. Operating systems schedule processes, manage virtual memory, and present device drivers so programs avoid dealing with raw signals. Compilers and toolchains translate high-level code into machine instructions, while runtimes add services such as dynamic linking and automatic memory management. Input devices turn motion and touch into digital streams; output subsystems render pixels, audio, and network packets. Networks extend the machine via protocol stacks that define addressing, reliability, and security. In effect, the computer functions by chaining simple, deterministic operations into long, coordinated sequences that deliver complex behavior with reliable accuracy and robust performance.
