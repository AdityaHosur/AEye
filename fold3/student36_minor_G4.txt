Computing systems process input into output using layered abstractions that manage data formats, control, and timing. Peripherals and storage deliver discretized symbols placed into memory. The processor advances the instruction stream by reading the program counter, fetching bytes, decoding operations, and issuing work to arithmetic, logic, and vector units. Pipelining and speculation raise utilization, and caches reduce latency by keeping active data near cores. Dynamic power management tunes voltage and frequency to meet energy and performance goals.

An operating system governs execution by scheduling threads, enforcing isolation with virtual memory and privilege levels, and providing drivers for devices. File systems structure persistent data, while network stacks packetize and secure communication. Hardware timers and interrupts align software with external events. In aggregate, the computer acts as a disciplined pipeline that maps symbolic inputs to outputs with guarantees for correctness, efficiency, and responsiveness.
