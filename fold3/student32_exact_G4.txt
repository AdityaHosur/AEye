A computer transforms inputs into outputs through coordinated layers that manage representation, control, and timing. Sensors, keyboards, and storage supply data that is encoded as discrete symbols and placed into memory. The central processor advances an instruction stream by consulting the program counter, fetching bytes from memory, interpreting operation codes, and directing arithmetic, logical, and vector units. Microarchitectural techniques such as pipelining and speculation increase throughput, while cache hierarchies shorten average access latency by keeping hot data close. Power and thermal controllers adjust frequency and voltage to meet performance and energy constraints.

The operating system provides the control plane. It schedules tasks across cores, enforces isolation using virtual memory and protection rings, and standardizes device access through drivers. File systems impose durable structure, journaling updates and recovering after failures. Networking stacks segment data into packets and reassemble streams with reliability and security measures. Timers and interrupts bind software to real time, allowing the machine to react to events with bounded latency. In effect, the computer is a disciplined pipeline from symbolic inputs to symbolic outputs, governed by protocols that ensure correctness, efficiency, and safety under changing workloads and physical limits.
