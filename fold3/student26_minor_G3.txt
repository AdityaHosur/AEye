Information in a computer is encoded as bits organized into bytes and words, with conventions such as two’s complement and IEEE 754 ensuring consistent arithmetic. The CPU’s core loop fetches instructions, decodes opcodes and operands, executes in ALUs or vector units, and writes results to registers or memory. Pipelining overlaps stages, while prediction and SIMD widen effective throughput. A tiered memory system—registers, caches, main memory, and storage—manages latency and capacity through locality principles.

The operating system mediates execution by scheduling threads, maintaining virtual address spaces, and providing system calls for I/O. Devices and GPUs digitize, buffer, and accelerate data processing; file systems impose structure and durability on storage. Networks exchange packets across layered protocols that negotiate addressing and reliability. Thus, computers render abstract algorithms into coordinated electrical behavior with repeatability, performance, and fault tolerance.
