A computer is a layered machine that turns human intention into tightly controlled electrical behavior. At the base, transistors operate as microscopic switches forming logic gates that carry out arithmetic and control decisions. These gates assemble into a datapath governed by a clock, where the CPU fetches instructions, decodes them, executes operations, and stores results. The memory hierarchy balances speed with capacity: registers sit beside the processor for single-cycle access; caches exploit locality to keep active data close; main memory houses running programs; persistent storage safeguards information without power. Interconnects and buses coordinate the movement of bits via standard protocols.

Software steers hardware using abstractions. An operating system schedules tasks, allocates memory, and exposes drivers so applications avoid dealing with raw signals. Compilers translate human-readable code into machine instructions, while runtimes offer services including dynamic loading and automated memory management. Input devices turn physical actions into digital streams; output devices present results as graphics, audio, or network messages. Networking broadens the computer through layered protocols that define addressing, reliability, and security. In total, the computer functions by composing simple deterministic steps into coordinated sequences that deliver complex behavior with repeatable accuracy and measurable performance.
