The computer is a layered system that transforms human intent into precise electrical operations. At the lowest level, transistors act as tiny switches creating logic gates that implement arithmetic and decision making. These gates are composed into a datapath controlled by a clock, where the central processing unit fetches instructions, decodes their meaning, executes operations, and writes results back. Memory hierarchy mediates speed and scale: registers sit closest to the CPU for single-cycle access; caches exploit locality to keep frequently used data near; main memory holds active programs; and persistent storage retains information when power is off. Buses and interconnects move bits among components using standardized protocols.

Software directs the hardware through layers of abstraction. The operating system schedules processes, manages memory, and exposes device drivers so applications need not handle raw signals. Compilers translate high-level code into machine instructions, while runtimes provide services such as dynamic loading and garbage collection. Input devices convert physical actions into digital data; output devices represent results as pixels, sound, or network packets. Networks extend the computer by enabling remote communication across standardized stacks where protocols govern addressing, reliability, and security. Altogether, the computer works by composing simple, deterministic operations into vast, coordinated sequences that realize complex tasks with repeatable precision and measurable performance.
