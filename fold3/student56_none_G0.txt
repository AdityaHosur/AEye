The operation of a computer can be framed as disciplined manipulation of symbolic state according to an encoded plan. Programs are stored as coded operations alongside their data. The processor repeatedly reads the next code, interprets it, and executes the indicated action. Fast working areas keep immediately needed values nearby, larger memory supports broad context, and nonvolatile devices safeguard records across power cycles. Data highways connect these elements and ensure that transfers occur in step with the system’s timing.

A coordinating layer schedules tasks and prevents them from interfering with one another. It also provides services that abstract the details of storage, displays, and networks. Devices at the edges translate the physical world into samples the machine can process and present outcomes in human-usable forms. Cooperation among computers relies on shared message formats and rules for delivery and protection. Through this structure the computer converts written procedures into dependable results, balancing swift response with stability and safety.
