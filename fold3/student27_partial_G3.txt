Computers encode data as bits arranged into bytes and words, and the processor follows a fetch–decode–execute cycle to apply operations with arithmetic and logic units. Pipelines and vector instructions enable multiple operations to proceed concurrently, while caches shorten access paths by exploiting locality.

Beyond these mechanisms, operating systems coordinate processes and threads, expose file and network APIs, and maintain isolation with virtual memory. Graphics processors accelerate parallel workloads such as rendering and model inference. File systems map names to blocks and maintain integrity in the face of failures. Protocol stacks route and deliver packets across networks. Together, these layers turn abstract programs into disciplined electrical activity that sustains correct and efficient execution.
