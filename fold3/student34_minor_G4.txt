A computer converts incoming data into useful results through layered mechanisms that regulate representation, coordination, and timing. Keyboards, sensors, and disks deliver information as discrete symbols that are placed in memory. The processor advances a stream of operations by reading the program counter, fetching instruction bytes, decoding opcodes, and driving arithmetic, logic, and vector units. Techniques like pipelining and speculative execution raise throughput, while cache hierarchies cut average latency by keeping active data close to the cores. Power and thermal management scale frequency and voltage to satisfy efficiency targets.

System software guides this process. The operating system schedules work across cores, isolates address spaces using virtual memory and protection levels, and normalizes device access via drivers. File systems maintain durable structure with journaling and recovery. Networking stacks packetize data and ensure ordered delivery with safeguards for security. Timers and interrupts connect software to real-world events. Overall, the computer forms a controlled pipeline from symbolic inputs to outputs, applying protocols that protect correctness and performance under dynamic workloads.
