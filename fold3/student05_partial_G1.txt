The computer is a layered system that transforms human intent into precise electrical operations. At the lowest level, transistors act as tiny switches creating logic gates for arithmetic and decision making. These gates are composed into a datapath controlled by a clock, where the CPU fetches instructions and decodes their meaning.

Beyond this foundation, modern design emphasizes how memory hierarchy and operating systems shape performance and usability. Registers deliver immediate access for critical steps, while caches maintain nearby copies of hot data to exploit locality. Main memory holds active programs, and persistent storage safeguards information during power cycles. The operating system multiplexes hardware among processes, enforces isolation, and mediates I/O through standardized interfaces. Device drivers abstract sensors and displays so applications can read and render without managing voltage levels. Networks turn the computer into a communicating node, layering protocols to route, secure, and retry transmissions as needed. Together these elements produce a machine that composes deterministic operations into sophisticated behaviors, enabling scientific workloads, creative tools, and responsive interfaces.
