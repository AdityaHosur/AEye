Transistors operate as microscopic switches that implement logic gates, and those gates assemble into a datapath controlled by a clock. The CPU repeatedly fetches instructions, decodes their meaning, executes operations, and stores results, while the memory hierarchy supplies data through registers, caches, and main memory, with storage retaining state across power cycles.

Around this engine sits software that organizes work. The operating system schedules processes, isolates address spaces, and exposes drivers so applications do not manipulate raw signals. Compilers turn source code into machine instructions and optimize for the target architecture. Input and output subsystems convert human actions into digital streams and render results as pixels, audio, or packets. Interconnects tie components together, and protocol stacks carry messages across networks. By combining these layers, the computer transforms simple, precise operations into complex, purposeful behavior that is repeatable, measurable, and robust in the face of varied workloads.
