Bits are grouped into bytes and words using standardized encodings so arithmetic remains consistent across hardware. The CPU fetches instructions, decodes them, executes on ALUs or vector units, and writes results to registers or memory. Caches and prediction maintain throughput by hiding memory delays and keeping data close to the core.

The broader system shapes reliability and scale. Operating systems schedule tasks and manage virtual memory; peripherals convert continuous signals into digital streams; GPUs accelerate highly parallel work. File systems structure persistent data and support recovery, while network stacks carry packets across heterogeneous links. In concert, these parts render high-level programs into reliable electrical activity capable of interactive and batch workloads.
