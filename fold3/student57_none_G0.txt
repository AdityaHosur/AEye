Computing systems transform descriptions of work into changes of digital state. Instructions and data live together in memory so the processor can read a step, interpret it, and perform the associated action on internal registers or memory locations. Very fast local stores serve immediate needs, while larger memory and durable media supply breadth and permanence. Wires and switching fabric move values among components with timing discipline that keeps producers and consumers aligned.

Above the circuits, a general supervisor manages time on processors, apportions memory, and provides consistent ways to write files, present images, and communicate. Input devices capture motion, sound, and light as digital samples; output devices present results back to people or to other machines. Collaboration among computers follows layered rules for addressing, error checking, and protection. The outcome is a platform that renders procedures into reliable information processing at electronic speeds.
