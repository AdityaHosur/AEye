State progresses as the CPU fetches from memory, decodes fields, and dispatches operations to functional units, while coherence and synchronization maintain consistent views of shared data among cores and threads. I/O engines exchange data with devices using interrupts and DMA.

At higher layers, operating systems schedule work, enforce isolation through virtual memory and privilege, and offer file and network APIs. Hypervisors provide guest isolation using hardware virtualization. Toolchains prepare binaries and loaders establish execution contexts. These mechanisms turn algorithmic descriptions into controlled state transitions with predictable outcomes.
