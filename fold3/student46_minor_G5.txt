Digital computers behave as clocked state machines whose transitions are governed by logic and sometimes microcode. The stored-program design keeps instructions alongside data in memory, enabling the processor to fetch, interpret, and issue operations that transform state. Concurrency arises from multiple cores and threads, with memory models describing which orderings are observed. Synchronization primitives and coherence maintain consistency when data is shared. I/O engines exchange data with devices by generating interrupts and using DMA to move buffers efficiently.

An operating system then multiplexes resources, isolates address spaces, and exports files, sockets, and drivers. Hypervisors extend isolation to guest systems using hardware virtualization and I/O remapping. Toolchains produce binaries and loaders set up execution contexts. In aggregate, the computer implements algorithms as controlled, observable state transitions with guarantees about isolation, progress, and performance.
