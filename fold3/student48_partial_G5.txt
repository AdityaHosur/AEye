Computers advance state with each clock tick according to rules implemented in circuits and microcode. Instructions and data share memory, enabling the processor to fetch an operation, decode its fields, and issue work to functional units. Concurrency stems from multiple cores and threads, with synchronization primitives coordinating access and coherence distributing updates.

The operating system multiplexes processors, isolates address spaces, and offers abstractions for devices and communication. Virtualization relies on hardware support to host entire guests with strong separation. Compilers and loaders produce binaries and arrange them for execution. Altogether, the machine translates algorithms into disciplined state changes with guarantees about isolation and progress.
