The essence of computer operation is controlled progression through a sequence of coded actions. The machine stores both the actions and the data they transform, allowing the processor to read an action, understand its fields, and execute it precisely. Rapid working areas keep active values near, larger memory provides breadth, and durable media preserve state over long periods. Electrical pathways and timing regimes synchronize transfers so that parts cooperate without conflict.

A management layer schedules tasks, prevents interference, and exports common services so applications can save data, communicate, and render results. Interfaces to sensors and displays translate between physical phenomena and digital symbols. In networks of machines, layered agreements carry messages reliably and protect them from tampering. By these means, the computer realizes written procedures as consistent transformations of information at high speed.
